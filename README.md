# Comparing Hierarchical Clustering Linkage Methods using Montana Childcare Data by County

In this analysis I explore several hierarchical clustering linkage methods using county-level childcare data from Montana.

The dataset for this project was collected through the Early Childhood Project Registry. This was part of a multivariate analysis project for Montana State University in Spring 2020, and was used to help compare childcare data for Montana counties for the Early Childhood Project.
